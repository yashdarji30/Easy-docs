## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```


**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
#Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up

#Liveblocks
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_KEY=
LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY=
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual Clerk & LiveBlocks credentials. You can obtain these credentials by signing up on the [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) and [Liveblocks](liveblocks.io/) website.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashdarji30/Easy-docs
cd Easy-docs
```

**Running the Project**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
